                <h2>My Summer Internship</h2>

                <P>For the past two consecutive summers I have had the pleasure of interning at the Ministry of Transport and Mining. I thought I knew what to expect: the same filing that I've experienced at my past summer jobs.  But, to my surpfise, even though I still had a lot of filing to do, I was also able to expand on my skills and actively experience what it was like to work in an environment similar to my chosen career. </p>
               
                <p>During my second internship I was asked to come up with a program to assist in the managing of files in the office.  Throughout the time I had been there, I had been assisting in file management for the department.  On more than one occasion, I had been called to help searh for a file and had to flip through piles upon piles of paper to see if we had received it, stamped it and sent it out.  The program I had been asked to create, would automate this process.  
               </p>
                <p>While I had written programs during my time at UWI, it was normally done in groupwork, but this time I was by myself.  I found myself spending ages searching up how to do things: things I had forgotten like how to connect a button to things such as writing an NSIS script to install the program.  At the end of my time there, I submitted the intial verison of my project.  While grateful for the experience, I know there are a plethora of things that I could have spent more time on or made more efficient. Nevertheless, I am proud of what I created.</p>
                <p>I am thankful for the opportunity to develop my skills and I hope that I can put the knowledge I have gathered from these internships to good use in my future work.</p>

                <h2>Close to the Finish Line</h2>

                <img id="pic2" src="article2img.png" alt="Picture of a finish line"/>
                <p>It's official! I'm now in my final year of university.  If all goes well, I will be graduating with a degree in Computer Science in 2022. There were a lot of ups and downs on this path, but now the finish line is right in sight.</p>
                <p>But even though I'm almost at the end of my university journey (for now at least), I have a lot of fear for the future.</p>
                <p>  Will I be successful?</p>
                <p>  Will I have a good job? </p>
                <p>Will I like my job?</p>
                <p>And there's no way for me to know for sure that the path that I am about to embark on is the right one.  So although this finish line is a time for excitement and celebration, it is also a time for worry. In the years to come I can only hope that the skills and people I have met on my unviersity journey are sufficient in helping me move forward.</p>
